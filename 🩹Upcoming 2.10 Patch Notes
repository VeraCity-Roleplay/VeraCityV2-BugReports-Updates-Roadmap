:Bee_happy:  Changelog v1.1.7 - Beekeeping
New Features:
Hives can now become infected, introducing a progressive severity mechanic.
Severity Levels: Infections worsen over time if untreated, increasing severity and causing greater harm.
Effects of Infection: Higher severities result in worker bee deaths, significant reductions in efficiency, and, in rare cases, the death of the queen bee.
You can treat infections with the new thymol item, please refer to the documentation for the new item.
You can purchase shields of varying quality to protect your hive from infections for specific durations. These shields are ideal for ensuring your hive operates at maximum efficiency, even overnight.

Optimizations:
The beekeepingData table has been augmented with purpose-specific sub-tables. While beekeepingData remains intact for full hive/house data, sub-tables are now utilized for common operations like ownership or collaborator checks. By iterating only over relevant data in these sub-tables, the script achieves faster and more efficient execution.
